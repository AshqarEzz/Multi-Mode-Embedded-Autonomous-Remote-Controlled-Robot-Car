🚗 Multi-Mode Embedded Autonomous & Remote-Controlled Robot Car
📌 Project Overview

This project is a multi-mode embedded robot car designed and implemented as part of an Embedded Systems course.
The system integrates autonomous navigation, infrared remote control, and Bluetooth mobile control into a single, unified control architecture.

The robot demonstrates sensor integration, real-time motor control, UART communication, and mode arbitration, making it a complete embedded control system rather than a single-sensor demo.

⚙️ Features

🤖 Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance

Ultrasonic distance sensing

Servo-based left/right scanning

Dynamic path selection based on free space

📺 IR Remote Control Mode (KY-022)

Real-time manual control using an IR remote

Immediate override of autonomous behavior

📱 Bluetooth Control Mode (HC-06 / ZS-040)

Android phone control via Bluetooth

UART communication using SoftwareSerial

Simple character-based command protocol

🔁 Multi-Mode Architecture

Three operating modes: Autonomous, IR, Bluetooth

Only one active mode at a time

Manual modes have higher priority than autonomous mode

🧠 System Architecture

The system is implemented as a state-based controller, where each input source (ultrasonic sensor, IR receiver, Bluetooth module) is handled independently.
A mode controller ensures safe arbitration so that motor outputs are driven by only one control source at any time.

Control Priority:

Bluetooth (highest)

IR Remote

Autonomous Navigation (default)

🎓 Educational Value

This project demonstrates key embedded systems concepts:

Peripheral integration

Serial communication (UART)

Real-time control logic

Modular software design

State machines and mode arbitration

It goes beyond single-sensor examples by showing how multiple input sources can coexist in a reliable embedded system.
